# Gemini Configuration For NomComVibes Project

## Coding Style
* Always add hashbang to all python files if they don't have one already
* Always make python files executable if they aren't already

## Safeguards
* Do not directly modify files in the config/, data/, and static/ directories
* Do not use the git command
